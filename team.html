                <p>Ever since the third grade, I’ve been fascinated by science and engineering, so I knew that robotics was something I wanted to try. I have done many STEM activities over these past few years, but FIRST stands out to me with its emphasis on community service. I particularly enjoy working with children and as such do a lot of mentoring and teaching. I didn’t get the opportunity to do anything like this when I was younger so I think it’s really important to share my love of engineering and spark this interest in people who may not otherwise be involved in the STEM fields.  Both as a senior and president of this team, I have also been focusing on ensuring the sustainability of this team. My role includes the general planning of meetings and events, being a builder, team relations particularly with our sister teams, leading the scouting at past competitions and leading work on this engineering notebook.</p>

I decided to join robotics because I wanted to learn more about engineering and about designing and building robots. I have been head of engineering on the team since last year, which means I lead and advise the team regarding robot design and construction. Aside from robotics, I enjoy playing flute, practicing karate, and watching superhero movies.</p>

Currently, I am the Head of Software Engineering, and I work on writing teleop and autonomous programs for the robot. Robotics helped spark my passion in computer science, and has been a huge learning experience for me. Outside of robotics, I am the Head of Web Development for Stuyvesant's Honor Society, and I enjoy playing basketball and soccer on weekends.</p>

                <p>I am a senior at Stuyvesant High School in New York City with broad interests in the social sciences and engineering. For the past two years, I’ve worked in two neuroscience labs where the primary focus has been on learning about neural processing of “social” information, especially as it pertains to emotion, choice, and social status. Additionally, I have performed instrumental music since fourth grade. This is my third year as a member of robotics and my favourite part of the team is the team dinners in Chinatown. In robotics I work on engineering and strategy. Particularly, during the build season I worked on the drivetrain and I will be leading scouting during competition. This year I’m looking forward to watching our underclassman take over the reins of the team as my year graduates. In university I’m hoping to major in biomedical engineering and neuroscience, with the goal of pursuing a career in research. To me the most inspiring scientists are John Forbes Nash because he managed to be a pivotal intellectual force despite mental illness, and Leonhard Euler because of the importance he placed on making his ideas simple enough for anyone to understand.</p>

Joining this team allowed me to play a role in all aspects of robotics and learn so much about engineering, programming, and strategy. Outside of robotics, I enjoy constantly learning more computer science languages and approaches. I also enjoy playing and learning new instruments along with other fine arts like drawing.</p>

                <p>I joined robotics to make a difference not only in my school and community but also in myself. By joining robotics, I thought I would change and learn new skills and assets to bring along with me to the future. Today, I'm glad I joined robotics for the fun community, good times we have here and the commitment we have into our robot. As an FTC engineer, I believe our robot can strive towards higher expectations, because as members we are constantly challenging one another to set high goals. We believe we can make a robot better than it was yesterday. Prior to joining robotics, school was on a tight schedule. But now, I have more time to do what I want. i was fascinated when I heard about the school's robotics team. But the experience is much more different than hearing about it. These past 2 years on the team has been great with new friends, newbies and robots being introduced each year.</p>

So, when I came to Stuyvesant, I thought I would prefer to get a better sense of all fields, and, rather than joining one of two specialized FRC teams, I chose to join FTC. Now, my primary role on the team has been engineering-- building attachments, learning to operate large machinery, etc. -- but I am eager to learn more from my more experienced teammates. Outside of robotics, I enjoy playing jazz clarinet and saxophone as well as learning Japanese.</p>

While a student, he was a member of our sister team, FRC StuyPulse 694. After graduating, he has consistently made sure to stay with the team, even as he was busy with college at SUNY - Stony Brook. Now he is actually a teacher at Stuyvesant (engineering design, precalculus and technical drawing) and therefore one of our official coaches, filling in the void that the retirement of Coach Rafael Colón has left.</p>
                <p>His incredible dedication to the team is really an inspiration to us, reminding all of us but especially the seniors the importance of coming back and continuing to influence and contribute to the team even after graduation.

                <h4>James Potter<span>Mentor</span></h4>
                <p>James Potter brings a unique view of the world around him to the team. He’s incredibly creative, often finding solutions that are incredibly innovative that never fail to greatly improve our robot. Not only does he provide his extensive knowledge of engineering but also support for the non-technical aspects of the team. He is always available to talk to and has become a friend.</p>
                <p>James Potter was first around when his son joined our school’s FRC team StuyPulse 694 but ended up staying after as a mentor when his son graduated. He has immense robotics spirit, attending as many meetings and competitions as he can for the past 8 years.  All of Stuyvesant Robotics is proud to call him our mentor.</p>

                <p>Dan Lavin is integral in helping our members learn about the machines present in our lab (and the safety procedures that come along with it!), the electronics that we might need to use including how to turn an old security camera into a potentiometer and the proper use of the milling equipment we have in our lab.</p>

                <h4>Rafael Col&oacute;n<span>Mentor</span></h4>
                <p>A noticeable gap in this lineup is our former head coach, Rafael Colón. While Mr. Colón has since retired, we are extremely grateful for all of the hard work, commitment and insights he has given us throughout the years. We are still following many of the precedents that he has set for us, including team-wide meetings at the start of each meeting where everyone, from president to newbie, is able to discuss exactly what we need to accomplish at this meeting.</p>
