                  <p>Ever since the third grade, I’ve been fascinated by science and engineering, so I knew that robotics was something I wanted to try. I have done many STEM activities over these past few years, but FIRST stands out to me with its emphasis on community service. I particularly enjoy working with children and as such do a lot of mentoring and teaching. I didn’t get the opportunity to do anything like this when I was younger so I think it’s really important to share my love of engineering and spark this interest in people who may not otherwise be involved in the STEM fields.  Both as a senior and president of this team, I have also been focusing on ensuring the sustainability of this team. My role includes the general planning of meetings and events, being a builder, team relations particularly with our sister teams, leading the scouting at past competitions and leading work on this engineering notebook.</p>

                  <p>I am in 11th grade, and this is my third year on team Stuy Fission. I decided to join robotics because I wanted to learn more about engineering and about designing and building robots. I have been head of engineering on the team since last year, which means I lead and advise the team regarding robot design and construction. Aside from robotics, I enjoy playing flute, practicing karate, and watching superhero movies.</p>

                  <p>I am a senior in my fourth year on an FTC team at Stuyvesant High School. I joined Stuy Fusion 479 in my freshman year, but switched over to Stuy Fission 310 in my junior year. Currently, I am the Head of Software Engineering, and I work on writing teleop and autonomous programs for the robot. Robotics helped spark my passion in computer science, and has been a huge learning experience for me. Outside of robotics, I am the Head of Web Development for Stuyvesant's Honor Society, and I enjoy playing basketball and soccer on weekends.</p>

                  <p>I've been on 310 since my freshman year, so this season will be my third year. I joined because I liked the passion the team leaders had, and the flexibility of roles. Now, I handle the team's CAD, 3D printing and electronics operations. When I have free time, I love to row on the Hudson with my friends, and build boats.</p>

                  <h4>Max Lobel<span>Senior, Marketing and Strategy</span></h4>
                  <p>I am a senior at Stuyvesant High School in New York City with broad interests in the social sciences and engineering. For the past two years, I’ve worked in two neuroscience labs where the primary focus has been on learning about neural processing of “social” information, especially as it pertains to emotion, choice, and social status. Additionally, I have performed instrumental music since fourth grade. This is my third year as a member of robotics and my favourite part of the team is the team dinners in Chinatown. In robotics I work on engineering and strategy. Particularly, during the build season I worked on the drivetrain and I will be leading scouting during competition. This year I’m looking forward to watching our underclassman take over the reins of the team as my year graduates. In university I’m hoping to major in biomedical engineering and neuroscience, with the goal of pursuing a career in research. To me the most inspiring scientists are John Forbes Nash because he managed to be a pivotal intellectual force despite mental illness, and Leonhard Euler because of the importance he placed on making his ideas simple enough for anyone to understand.</p>

                  <p>I joined this team because I had not decided on one specific aspect of robotics I wanted to work on. Since joining, I have been on the team for two years and am currently in 10th grade. Joining this team allowed me to play a role in all aspects of robotics and learn so much about engineering, programming, and strategy. Outside of robotics, I enjoy constantly learning more computer science languages and approaches. I also enjoy playing and learning new instruments along with other fine arts like drawing.</p>
