            <p>The team charter was written and approved by the 2016-17 team.</p>
            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <h4>Mission</h4>
            <p>Stuy Fission 310 is a division of the Stuyvesant Robotics team devoted to building and programming robots for the FTC competition. Over the course of the school year, we construct and program an innovative robot to compete and later demo with, while raising funds and spreading the ideals of FIRST to our community.</p>
            <h4>Description</h4>
            <p>Over the course of the build season, the Stuy Fission 310 will employ engineering, problem-solving, and creativity to design, build and program a competitive robot in hopes of winning first our Qualifiers then the FTC NYC Regional Competition and other tournaments. We will apply real-world math and science concepts while developing strategic problem-solving, organizational, and team-building skills. This goes hand in hand with training new members to engineer, program, and compete, so that they may lead the team in the future. In order to continue to improve, we will keep careful records of our meetings. We will also raise money and spread awareness of the FIRST mission through the marketing facet of our team. Finally while we are proud of our skills and creations, we recognize the value of connecting with and learning from other teams.</p>
            <p>Stuy Fission 310 will not restrict membership or otherwise discriminate on the basis of race, color, ethnicity, national origin, gender, sex, sexual orientation, disability, age, grade or any other such factors. However, attendance and conduct during meetings can result in removal with the approval of faculty advisors.</p>
            <h4>Charter Amendments</h4>
            <p>The amendment process will begin sometime between the time of our last competition and elections. The president of the team will decide a time and date for the open charter amendment meeting to occur but a simple majority of <strong>active members</strong> must be present in the meeting for the changes to be considered valid.</p>
            <p>The president is responsible for announcing the date of the open charter amendment meeting at least a week before the meeting as to allow members time to reread the charter if they wish. During this time, members may bring up any changes they wish to make to start the discussion. These changes will be prioritized during the charter meeting. If a member of the faculty finds fault within the charter, it is up to the EEC to make these changes. Another meeting will not be called.</p>
            <h3>Team Dynamics</h3>
            <h4>Appointment of Officers</h4>
            <p>Elections for team officers are held after the charter meeting and before the team dinner. Once again the president has the responsibility to schedule this election and find someone to lead the election. A senior member who will not vote will lead the election. If a senior member is not available, a current EEC member who is not a candidate may lead the election. If that is still not possible, seniors or EEC from StuyPulse 694 may lead the election. Notice of the election must be given at least two weeks prior. All current team officers (unless said officers are willing to allow the elections to happen without their presence) and once again more than half of <strong>active members</strong> must be present.</p>
            <p>A member becomes a candidate when they send the leader of the election their candidacy paragraph. The leader of the election will release all candidacy paragraphs at the same time, at least three days before the election. The other way to become a candidate is a nomination from current officers that is seconded by any active member. If the nominated individual accepts, they will be a candidate regardless of whether or not they sent their candidacy paragraph. Each candidate can choose to give a brief speech on the day of the election, though this is optional. Candidates have 8 minutes to make their speech and there will be 7 minutes for a Q&A session from the voters and the leader of the election. The leader of the election will decide if candidates break the rules of conduct. During elections, all voting is conducted through written ballots and counted by the leader of the elections. If there are more than two candidates and a majority is not reached for any single candidate, a runoff election will occur. If an active member is unable to attend the meeting but would like to vote, they must inform the leader of the election at least 24 hours prior and be approved by the leader of the election. In the event of a tie, the leader of the election may cast a vote. After all the votes are collected for one position, the winning candidate is announced. If a member ran for president but lost, they may run for vice president.</p>
            <p>In the case that no member runs for an elected position, the current officer will appoint their successor. After all elected positions are filled, the elected officers are given a week to discuss the candidates for any appointed officers, which may include interviews or consultation with candidates, and choose the appointed officers.</p>
            <p><strong>EEC</strong> elections run as follows: if there are no co-presidency candidate pairs, then solo President candidates will run against each other to determine the President. Similarly, if there are no solo President candidates, then Vice-President candidates will not be considered and Co-President candidate pairs will run against each other to determine the presidency. However, if there are both Co-President and solo President candidates, then a solo President candidate will be elected first, followed by a Vice-President candidate, followed by a Co-President candidate pair. The solo President and the Vice-President will then run against the Co-President candidate in another vote.</p>
            <h5>Rules of Conduct for Elections</h5>
            <ol>
              <li><p>There will be absolutely no insulting on the basis of things irrelevant to the position such as: race, ethnicity, gender, sex, sexual orientation etc. Candidates will be given one (public) warning should they break this rule and one only. After the warning, breaking this rule again will result in immediate disqualification.</p></li>
              <li><p>Similarly, gracious professionalism should be adhered to in every step of the process. This means that things like the following are frowned upon: aggressively negative campaigns, attacks on personal character, and threats. Candidates will be given one public warning should they break this rule. After the warning, the leader of the election reserves the right to give another warning or to disqualify the candidate.</p></li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Description of Positions</h4>
            <h5>EEC</h5>
            <h6>President (elected)</h6>
            <p>The Presidentâ€™s chief responsibility is to coordinate all administrative tasks for the team. The elected individual should be someone who has gained strong technical expertise on the team, as well as strong communication skills. The President will work closely with the team to create a design and lead in the building of their robot. They will send out messages via the official means of communication with new developments and considerations, upcoming meetings and deadlines, plans for the next meeting, and updates about the Stuyvesant Robotics team as a whole, or delegate the task to other reliable members. Furthermore, the President will be the voice of the team whenever communicating with sister teams, faculty advisers, as well as the community, and will be in charge of redirecting them to the appropriate individuals. If a simple majority of the affected active members disagree with an EEC decision, however, then the decision will be recalled and it is overridden.</p>
            <h6>Vice-President (elected)</h6>
            <p>The Vice-President will work closely with the President and other members of the team to build the competition robot. They will take their president's place when he or she is not present. The Vice-president will communicate with team members, conduct communication between teams, and help his/her President or teammates as needed.</p>
            <h6>2 Co-Presidents (elected)</h6>
            <p>Two candidates may run together as Co-Presidents if they wish. In order to do so, they must explicitly state this during their candidacy email and must have the same candidacy email. Additionally, Co-Presidents are elected and impeached together. Co-Presidents will have the combined responsibilities of the President and Vice-President, and must make decisions as a unit.</p>
            <h5>EC</h5>
            <h6>Head of Engineering (appointed)</h6>
            <p>There will be a Head of Engineering who will advise the Presidents on decisions made in respect to mechanical engineering and design. They will be expected to have the most expertise on the team in engineering or second only to the President.</p>

Together, with FRC marketing, the Head of Marketing will organize events, raise money, perform outreach, and write to sponsors. In addition, the Head of Marketing will be involved in assisting the communication between FRC and FTC. They will be expected to have the most expertise on the team in marketing or second only to the President.</p>
            <h6>Head of Documentation (appointed)</h6>
            <p>There can be a Head of Documentation who will lead the team in terms of documentation. They will be in charge of managing the Engineering Notebook and recording what the team does in terms of events. In addition, it is their responsibility to delegate people to contribute to the Engineering Notebook, which will be written by those individuals at the end of each meeting.</p>
            <h6>Head of Strategy (appointed)</h6>
            <p>There can be a Head of Strategy who will be in charge of game strategy and scouting. During the build season, they will assist in determining autonomous and teleop strategies. They will ensure that all members know the rules and regulations of the game. During competition, they will be in charge of scouting, which includes scouting teams before competition and figuring out what other teams claim to do, and managing scouting during matches. They will be expected to have the most expertise on the team in strategy or second only to the President.</p>
            <h6>Head of Operations (appointed)</h6>
            <p>There can be a Head of Operations who will be responsible for the day to day operations of the team. This person will help the EEC communicate with the team the meeting dates, deadlines and responsibilities of the team as well as handle some of the paperwork for the team. The Head of Operations may be involved in ensuring that all members have turned in their medicals and other paperwork at the beginning of the seasons, trip forms during the season as well as maintaining the teamâ€™s order form.</p>
            <h4>Rules and Regulations</h4>
            <p>Members are expected to exhibit gracious professionalism at all times. Members must complete a minimum set of tasks as dictated by the President at the beginning of the season. This includes participating in Stuyvesant Robotics events like the book sale or bake sales a certain number of times as well as completing meeting notes on days of which they were assigned. Members should check the official means of communications at least once a day to ensure that that they are up to date with information like meeting times, agenda etc. A certain level of attendance is also required, as dictated by the President. If a prolonged absence should be expected (such as illness or travel), the EC should be informed as soon as possible.</p>
            <h4>Removal from Office</h4>
            <p>Impeachments will be proposed with restraint, and only in the case of obvious neglect of team duties, including, but not limited to, breaking a rule stated in this charter, misrepresenting the goal and spirit of Stuyvesant Robotics, and/or excessive absences (see below). They should not be personal attacks aimed at the team leaders. Anyone wishing to bring up the issue of impeachment will do so through any <strong>official means of communication</strong>. At the beginning of the next <strong>meeting</strong>, the person or party will briefly explain their case. The impeached individual will then have half an hour to present their case, during which other team members can also voice their opinions. After the meeting ends or half an hour passes, a blind vote will be cast and counted by a faculty advisor or mentor. If a three quarters majority of <strong>active members</strong> not including the accused or the accuser is reached, faculty advisers shall be notified of the case. If they both approve, the officer shall be removed. Impeachments cannot occur a month before the regional.</p>
            <p>In the case of three unexcused consecutive absences for <strong>EEC</strong> members, a warning will be issued. After another consecutive absence, a final warning is issued. If the said member is absent for a fifth consecutive <strong>meeting</strong>, a vote will be taken by <strong>active members</strong> of the team. If a 2/3 majority agrees an impeachment is needed, the issue will be brought to the faculty advisers. If they both approve, the officer shall be removed.</p>
            <h4>Removal from the Team</h4>
            <p>If a member is considered underperforming by a 2/3 majority of the EC, the offending member will be informed at the next meeting or through another means of communication. If the problem persists after 3-5 meetings, this will be brought to the faculty advisers.</p>
            <p>If a member is exhibiting poor behavior, there will be only one warning from the EC. After this warning, another infraction will result in a meeting with the faculty advisers.</p>
            <h3>Definitions</h3>
            <p>An <strong>active member</strong> is defined to be someone who has fulfilled all of their necessary duties to be a Stuyvesant Robotics member and has participated in over 50% of meetings during our build season, not including the first ten. If a member does not meet the above requirements, but the EEC believes that the work the member has contributed merits distinction, the member can be considered an active member. Only active members can vote or run in elections and if there is a shortage of medals at competition, active members will be prioritized. Otherwise there is no distinction between active members and inactive members.</p>
            <p><strong>Build season</strong> - The period of time between the day of kickoff and the day of the teamâ€™s final competition during the season, inclusive.</p>
            <p><strong>Official means of communication</strong> - Any platform that allows all group members to receive notifications about the team. May include, but are not limited to, the Stuyvesant Robotics email group, the official team chat, and/or the official team website.</p>
            <p><strong>Official meeting</strong> - A meeting called by a faculty advisor to the Stuyvesant Robotics team.</p>
