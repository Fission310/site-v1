On October 8th, the First Community Events Planning Committee (or CEPC) held the first ever NYC FTC Splash at Cornell Tech. Both Stuy Fission 310 and our sister team Stuy Fusion 479 held workshops throughout the day. Two of our team members, Arzit Pal and Joe Suzuki gave workshops on Computer-aided design and Computer Vision respectfully. We had a great time talking and learning with the other attendees at FTC Splash. Check out our [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/stuyfission/?hl=en) for more updates!
