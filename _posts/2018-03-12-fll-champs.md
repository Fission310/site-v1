This past Sunday was the NYC FLL Championship. Several members of our team are heavily involved with FLL - both through mentoring and volunteering for events. As such, we were very excited to volunteer for the Championship. In combination with our sister team (FRC StuyPulse 694) and our school's Honor Society, we were referees, mentors, queuers and judges. Although volunteering was difficult and tiring, especially with 63(!) teams present, 24 judging rooms and 2 different buildings, the enthusiasm of the FLL teams was infectious. Queuing allowed me the opportunity to interact with teams as I brought them to their judging rooms. In these short trips, I had the opportunity to talk to these students about their projects and robots. As I learned about the various solutions these elementary and middle schoolers came up with, I was seriously impressed by the level of knowledge and maturity that these students show.

We were also impressed by the robots of the teams we mentor. Team 5355 reached rank 4 with a high score of 160! Although 5893, 9577, 28864, 2562, and the 11841 did not place in the top ten, we were amazed by the sophistication of their bots as well as all they learned in the building process. We are looking forward to watching these teams grow in coming years!
