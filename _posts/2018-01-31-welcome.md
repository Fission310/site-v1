Welcome to the launch of our website! Remade in [Materialize](http://materializecss.com/) and [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), this website now serves as a blog as well as a virtual portfolio of our team.

##### What's New
* Blog awareness; posts can be made by adding Markdown files to the `_posts` directory in the repository
* Completely new UI, built using Materialize
* Added "Sponsors" page, removing the sponsor logos from the "About Us" page
  * Added pictures to "About Us" page, in the spot previously occupied by sponsor logos
