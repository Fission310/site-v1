#### Executive Council

##### Lili Boenigk
Senior, President

Ever since the third grade, I’ve been fascinated by science and engineering, so I knew that robotics was something I wanted to try. I have done many STEM activities over these past few years, but FIRST stands out to me with its emphasis on community service. I particularly enjoy working with children and as such do a lot of mentoring and teaching. I didn’t get the opportunity to do anything like this when I was younger so I think it’s really important to share my love of engineering and spark this interest in people who may not otherwise be involved in the STEM fields.  Both as a senior and president of this team, I have also been focusing on ensuring the sustainability of this team. My role includes the general planning of meetings and events, being a builder, team relations particularly with our sister teams, leading the scouting at past competitions and leading work on this engineering notebook.

##### Megan Gupta-She
Sophomore, Vice President

My name is Megan Gupta-She and this is my first year on Stuy Fission 310. Even though this is my first year on FTC, I am not completely new to robotics. I have been interested in robotics for as long as I can remember and have been in FLL previously. I also mentor a FLL team named Robotron #5355. Other than robotics, I also play lacrosse.

#### Cabinet

##### Arizit Pal
Senior, Head of Engineering

I joined robotics to make a difference not only in my school and community but also in myself. By joining robotics, I thought I would change and learn new skills and assets to bring along with me to the future. Today, I'm glad I joined robotics for the fun community, good times we have here and the commitment we have into our robot. As an FTC engineer, I believe our robot can strive towards higher expectations, because as members we are constantly challenging one another to set high goals. We believe we can make a robot better than it was yesterday. Prior to joining robotics, school was on a tight schedule. But now, I have more time to do what I want. I was fascinated when I heard about the school's robotics team. But the experience is much more different than hearing about it. These past 2 years on the team has been great with new friends, newbies and robots being introduced each year.

##### Joe Suzuki
Senior, Head of Software Engineering

I was born and raised in Queens, NY and I’m now a junior at Stuyvesant High School with interests in technology and entrepreneurship. I'm currently on the robotics team because I enjoy working with others and learning how a successful team operates. I have enjoyed my two and a half years in team 310, because I've met great people and learned a-lot. After graduating Stuyvesant, I hope to work at a startup company, helping people’s lives.

#### Coaches and Mentors

##### James Lonardo
Coach

James Lonardo has served our team for over eight years. He attends many of our late night, weekend and break meetings all year long. He organizes all of our paperwork from our medicals to trip forms, which is no easy task when Stuyvesant Robotics has close to one hundred and twenty members. Mr. Lonardo proves to be the “backbone of our team” when he signs us up for events and orders all of the parts that we need for the season.

##### Joseph Blay
Coach

Joe Blay has had a tremendous impact on our team since his own high school years. Mr. Blay was actually a former Stuyvesant High School student, graduating in 2009. While a student, he was a member of our sister team, FRC StuyPulse 694. After graduating, he has consistently made sure to stay with the team, even as he was busy with college at SUNY - Stony Brook. Now he is actually a teacher at Stuyvesant (engineering design, precalculus and technical drawing) and therefore one of our official coaches, filling in the void that the retirement of Coach Rafael Colón has left.

His incredible dedication to the team is really an inspiration to us, reminding all of us but especially the seniors the importance of coming back and continuing to influence and contribute to the team even after graduation. His presence is also what allows us to have our late night or weekend meetings that are crucial to ensuring that our robot is completed in a timely manner.

##### James Potter
Mentor

James Potter brings a unique view of the world around him to the team. He’s incredibly creative, often finding solutions that are incredibly innovative that never fail to greatly improve our robot. Not only does he provide his extensive knowledge of engineering but also support for the non-technical aspects of the team. He is always available to talk to and has become a friend.

James Potter was first around when his son joined our school’s FRC team StuyPulse 694 but ended up staying after as a mentor when his son graduated. He has immense robotics spirit, attending as many meetings and competitions as he can for the past 8 years. All of Stuyvesant Robotics is proud to call him our mentor.

##### Dan Lavin
Mentor

Dan Lavin is integral in helping our members learn about the machines present in our lab (and the safety procedures that come along with it!), the electronics that we might need to use including how to turn an old security camera into a potentiometer and the proper use of the milling equipment we have in our lab.

##### Rafael Colón
Former Coach

A noticeable gap in this lineup is our former head coach, Rafael Colón. While Mr. Colón has since retired, we are extremely grateful for all of the hard work, commitment and insights he has given us throughout the years. We are still following many of the precedents that he has set for us, including team-wide meetings at the start of each meeting where everyone, from president to newbie, is able to discuss exactly what we need to accomplish at this meeting.
