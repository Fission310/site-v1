#### Executive Council

##### Lili Boenigk
Senior, President

Ever since the third grade, I’ve been fascinated by science and engineering, so I knew that robotics was something I wanted to try. I have done many STEM activities over these past few years, but FIRST stands out to me with its emphasis on community service. I particularly enjoy working with children and as such do a lot of mentoring and teaching. I didn’t get the opportunity to do anything like this when I was younger so I think it’s really important to share my love of engineering and spark this interest in people who may not otherwise be involved in the STEM fields.  Both as a senior and president of this team, I have also been focusing on ensuring the sustainability of this team. My role includes the general planning of meetings and events, being a builder, team relations particularly with our sister teams, leading the scouting at past competitions and leading work on this engineering notebook.

##### Megan Gupta-She
Sophomore, Vice President

When I was young, my parents thought that it was very important to try everything to try to find what you love. I tried everything from ballet to art to robotics. I was lucky enough to find what I love so early on. Through all the insane things that I have tried, robotics has always stuck. When I came to Stuyvesant, I was overwhelmed, as everyone is when they walk through the entrance on the first day of school. Getting lost at such a large school is easy and everyone needs someplace that grounds them. Robotics is that place for me. I love every part of the competition, the building, marketing, scouting, strategics, the mentors and mentees and it has become a part of my identity. As the vice president of this team, I work to move our team forward whether that is writing the Engineering Notebook, teaching newbies, delegating building and coding, organizing outreach events, or meeting with mentors and coaches to discuss different aspects of the team. This robotics team has become my family and there is no other team I'd rather go through competition season with. I enjoy mentoring 2 FLL teams and playing lacrosse in my free time.

#### Cabinet

##### Arizit Pal
Senior, Head of Engineering

I was always interested in engineering and coming up with creative solutions to problems. Whether these solutions involved LEGOs, paper, or even popsicle sticks, I enjoyed the creativity and the variability of my solutions. By joining robotics and FTC, I was able to continue what I love doing. Except now, it’s not LEGOs anymore, but metal, wood, and aluminum where we use these parts to build actual robots that can do specific tasks. As the Head of Engineering, I am responsible for the completion of the various mechanisms and prototypes and the integration into our robot. I believe our robot can strive towards higher expectations, because our team is constantly being challenged from our own peers and mentors. These past 3 years on the team has been great and fun to work with because each year there is something different among the game, the robot and even our team. As a senior at Stuy, here’s to one more unforgettable last year. ლ(ಠ益ಠლ)

##### Joe Suzuki
Senior, Head of Software Engineering

Growing up in Queens, NY I always envisioned myself doing something in the big city, Manhattan. I’ll admit, I had no idea what I wanted to do in the city, but the dream of transforming people’s lives for the greater always sparked an inner flame. I suppose you can say that I was inspired by my favorite superhero Tony Stark. The first Iron Man film inspired me to love robotics. So it was definitely no surprise that I chose to join my school’s FTC Robotics team as a freshman in high school. I started out an engineer on the team but it was only after the first qualifiers of my sophomore year that I saw how lacking the Software Engineering department was. From that point on I decided to change gears and become a software engineer for the team. Now as a senior in high school, I can look back at all the ways I changed, but also look forward to how I can influence others around me. This year, I will step in the shoes of my predecessors and fulfill the role of leading the SE department. I know this year will be challenging, leading a group of newbies was never a common skill of mine, but with the support of my team, I know that I can do something that younger Joe could only dream of. I made it my mission to motivate the generation before me and I know that by leading my current SE team to the best of my ability now, they will be able to carry my vision to the next generation and the generation after that.

#### Members

##### Nafis Uddin
Senior, Engineering

As a child, my eagerness to learn was only surpassed by my awkwardness around others. I found it troublesome connecting with others for few of my peers had the same background as I did. I was an immigrant coming from Bangladesh and my parents had, from an early age on, stressed the importance of a well-rounded education. I found my niche at Stuyvesant High School and specifically in Team Fission. It was an environment that nurtured my passion for the maths and sciences, but more importantly, it allowed me to shed my former shyness. Joining the robotics team taught me the importance of people skills and synergy. Working closely with the team and hearing their ideas encouraged me to speak up more and share my own opinion. As a senior, my time with the team -- the long meetings, the late dinners, the competitions, the cheering -- has immensely shaped my character, and what I’ve learned about teamwork and working amongst others is something I will carry with me for the rest of my life.

#### Coaches and Mentors

##### James Lonardo
Coach

James Lonardo has served our team for over eight years. He attends many of our late night, weekend and break meetings all year long. He organizes all of our paperwork from our medicals to trip forms, which is no easy task when Stuyvesant Robotics has close to one hundred and twenty members. Mr. Lonardo proves to be the “backbone of our team” when he signs us up for events and orders all of the parts that we need for the season.

##### Joseph Blay
Coach

Joe Blay has had a tremendous impact on our team since his own high school years. Mr. Blay was actually a former Stuyvesant High School student, graduating in 2009. While a student, he was a member of our sister team, FRC StuyPulse 694. After graduating, he has consistently made sure to stay with the team, even as he was busy with college at SUNY - Stony Brook. Now he is actually a teacher at Stuyvesant (engineering design, precalculus and technical drawing) and therefore one of our official coaches, filling in the void that the retirement of Coach Rafael Colón has left.

His incredible dedication to the team is really an inspiration to us, reminding all of us but especially the seniors the importance of coming back and continuing to influence and contribute to the team even after graduation. His presence is also what allows us to have our late night or weekend meetings that are crucial to ensuring that our robot is completed in a timely manner.

##### James Potter
Mentor

James Potter brings a unique view of the world around him to the team. He’s incredibly creative, often finding solutions that are incredibly innovative that never fail to greatly improve our robot. Not only does he provide his extensive knowledge of engineering but also support for the non-technical aspects of the team. He is always available to talk to and has become a friend.

James Potter was first around when his son joined our school’s FRC team StuyPulse 694 but ended up staying after as a mentor when his son graduated. He has immense robotics spirit, attending as many meetings and competitions as he can for the past 8 years. All of Stuyvesant Robotics is proud to call him our mentor.

##### Dan Lavin
Mentor

Dan Lavin is integral in helping our members learn about the machines present in our lab (and the safety procedures that come along with it!), the electronics that we might need to use including how to turn an old security camera into a potentiometer and the proper use of the milling equipment we have in our lab.

##### Rafael Colón
Former Coach

A noticeable gap in this lineup is our former head coach, Rafael Colón. While Mr. Colón has since retired, we are extremely grateful for all of the hard work, commitment and insights he has given us throughout the years. We are still following many of the precedents that he has set for us, including team-wide meetings at the start of each meeting where everyone, from president to newbie, is able to discuss exactly what we need to accomplish at this meeting.
