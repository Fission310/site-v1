#### Executive Council

##### Lili Boenigk
Senior, President

My favorite hobby growing up was building balsa wood model airplanes. As much as I loved the hands-on aspect of cutting and gluing, what really captivated me was the design process, and the creative nature of engineering. The progression from an idea to a plan to a functional object creates a sense of accomplishment that is difficult to find in other hobbies. Joining Stuy Fission 310 during my freshman year felt natural. Robotics encourages the same kind of creative problem solving I loved about model airplanes, and success as a team is based on a good execution of the design process. My favorite parts of the season are the days I spend brainstorming with my team, joking around and coming up with creative and sometimes crazy solutions to the game's challenges. As a leader, I focus on documentation, coordinating outreach and sponsorships, and newbie education such that my team can grow into the future. 

##### Megan Gupta-She
Sophomore, Vice President

When I was young, my parents thought that it was very important to try everything to try to find what you love. I tried everything from ballet to art to robotics. I was lucky enough to find what I love so early on. Through all the insane things that I have tried, robotics has always stuck. When I came to Stuyvesant, I was overwhelmed, as everyone is when they walk through the entrance on the first day of school. Getting lost at such a large school is easy and everyone needs someplace that grounds them. Robotics is that place for me. I love every part of the competition, the building, marketing, scouting, strategics, the mentors and mentees and it has become a part of my identity. As the vice president of this team, I work to move our team forward whether that is writing the Engineering Notebook, teaching newbies, delegating building and coding, organizing outreach events, or meeting with mentors and coaches to discuss different aspects of the team. This robotics team has become my family and there is no other team I'd rather go through competition season with. I enjoy mentoring 2 FLL teams and playing lacrosse in my free time.

#### Cabinet

##### Arizit Pal
Senior, Head of Engineering

I was always interested in engineering and coming up with creative solutions to problems. Whether these solutions involved LEGOs, paper, or even popsicle sticks, I enjoyed the creativity and the variability of my solutions. By joining robotics and FTC, I was able to continue what I love doing. Except now, it’s not LEGOs anymore, but metal, wood, and aluminum where we use these parts to build actual robots that can do specific tasks. As the Head of Engineering, I am responsible for the completion of the various mechanisms and prototypes and the integration into our robot. I believe our robot can strive towards higher expectations, because our team is constantly being challenged from our own peers and mentors. These past 3 years on the team has been great and fun to work with because each year there is something different among the game, the robot and even our team. As a senior at Stuy, here’s to one more unforgettable last year. ლ(ಠ益ಠლ)

##### Joe Suzuki
Senior, Head of Software Engineering

Growing up in Queens, NY I always envisioned myself doing something in the big city, Manhattan. I’ll admit, I had no idea what I wanted to do in the city, but the dream of transforming people’s lives for the greater always sparked an inner flame. I suppose you can say that I was inspired by my favorite superhero Tony Stark. The first Iron Man film inspired me to love robotics. So it was definitely no surprise that I chose to join my school’s FTC Robotics team as a freshman in high school. I started out an engineer on the team but it was only after the first qualifiers of my sophomore year that I saw how lacking the Software Engineering department was. From that point on I decided to change gears and become a software engineer for the team. Now as a senior in high school, I can look back at all the ways I changed, but also look forward to how I can influence others around me. This year, I will step in the shoes of my predecessors and fulfill the role of leading the SE department. I know this year will be challenging, leading a group of newbies was never a common skill of mine, but with the support of my team, I know that I can do something that younger Joe could only dream of. I made it my mission to motivate the generation before me and I know that by leading my current SE team to the best of my ability now, they will be able to carry my vision to the next generation and the generation after that.

#### Members

##### Nafis Uddin
Senior, Engineering

As a child, my eagerness to learn was only surpassed by my awkwardness around others. I found it troublesome connecting with others for few of my peers had the same background as I did. I was an immigrant coming from Bangladesh and my parents had, from an early age on, stressed the importance of a well-rounded education. I found my niche at Stuyvesant High School and specifically in Team Fission. It was an environment that nurtured my passion for the maths and sciences, but more importantly, it allowed me to shed my former shyness. Joining the robotics team taught me the importance of people skills and synergy. Working closely with the team and hearing their ideas encouraged me to speak up more and share my own opinion. As a senior, my time with the team -- the long meetings, the late dinners, the competitions, the cheering -- has immensely shaped my character, and what I’ve learned about teamwork and working amongst others is something I will carry with me for the rest of my life. 

##### Emily Tan
Freshman, Engineering

My name is Qiao Ying (Emily) and this is my first year in robotics. I joined because I thought I would enjoy engineering and it would be a chance to learn a bit of software. I thought robotics would give lots of opportunities for me to interact with different people. I am also interested in drawing and sketching, which is also why I wanted to mainly do engineering.

##### Aaron Hsu
Freshman, Software Engineering

The first time that I saw a machine deconstructed was when my dad took apart a broken alarm clock when I was 10. Each individual part that made up the clock intrigued me. The composition of seemingly simple pieces worked together to create a functioning machine with a specific purpose. During middle school, I experimented with code and developed a liking towards it. Similar to the alarm clock, the composition of each line of code worked together to form a program. I joined robotics because I want to develop and apply my ability to code to a project that I can work on with others.

##### Tasnuba Sukanna
Senior, Marketing

As a child, I loved reading mystery/spy fiction books, where characters got out of sticky situations using their wits and abilities. I was always in awe of the characters who would resourcefully build a contraption or use their knowledge of mechanisms to figure things out. I fueled this interest by watching YouTube videos and reading instructions on WikiHow to make my own motion detectors and homemade mousetrap cars. If not begging my mom to take to me to RadioShack, I would always take old pens and electronic toys apart, salvaging the parts and hoarding them for years, just in case I needed them for a project. When I entered high school, robotics was the only club I had my eyes for. Our victory banners covering the walls of our school gave me a sense of pride and excitement to join and contribute. Joining this team was critical for my development because I suddenly realized there was so much I didn't know. Especially because the majority of my teammates were in FLL teams and already familiar with robotics, I felt super isolated from my team. However, this gave me the opportunity to figure out what exactly I was missing and work on it. As a freshman, I was intimidated by the upperclassmen but soon gained confidence talk to them about their experiences in engineering. This helped me to take initiative outside of school and robotics, and pave my passion for engineering.

##### Henry lin
Freshman, Engineering

From a very young age, my parents always expected very much of me. They would always compare me to others and tell me how I'm lacking behind. To please them, I tried to make it to stuy, and I ended up doing just that. The first day here, I could already tell it's going to be very hard, with the amount of stairs we have to climb and quizzes and test every week. I joined robotics as a way to relieve my stress and have some fun making new friends. My personal hobbies and interests are sleeping, eating, playing, and watching anime. By joining robotics, I hope to find someone with the same interest as me.

##### Kelly Hu
Freshman, Software Engineering

Growing up, I loved to create things. I have always been more interested in the tangible and things that take up space. That is why I picked up drawing. It was a way for me to make things that are also visually appealing. However, I soon learned that it would not be of much use to me in the future to just draw. Though I have no hate to those with art degrees and careers involving the arts, I feel that it would never benefit me in any way other than to be to brag about how well I draw; which isn’t that well at all. So when I learned that Stuyvesant had a robotics team, I knew that it would be the perfect club for me. Robotics can give me a chance to learn how to make machines and program them to do tasks that we can do. Furthermore, programming had always caught my interest in this growing age of technology. The only problem was that I didn’t know how to start learning, so when I was given an opportunity to learn it, I took it. That is why I joined robotics.

##### Naomi Naranjo
Freshman, Engineering

My name is Naomi, and this is my first year in robotics. Since I was a child I always loved the idea of being on a team and getting to work with others to create something new. So when I learned that Stuyvesant had a robotics team, I quickly signed up. So far it has been a great experience being on 310 and learning from the mentors on my time. I look forward to spending time in robotics, and with my new team. Some other things that I enjoy in my free time are reading and songwriting.

##### Marko Zimic
Freshman, Engineering

I joined robotics because I have done robotics with FIRST for a long time and I really liked it, so I wanted to maintain the action by joining Stuy’s team. Currently, I am but a newbie on the team and am still learning the ropes.

#### Coaches and Mentors

##### James Lonardo
Coach

James Lonardo has served our team for over eight years. He attends many of our late night, weekend and break meetings all year long. He organizes all of our paperwork from our medicals to trip forms, which is no easy task when Stuyvesant Robotics has close to one hundred and twenty members. Mr. Lonardo proves to be the “backbone of our team” when he signs us up for events and orders all of the parts that we need for the season.

##### Joseph Blay
Coach

Mr. Blay has had a tremendous impact on our team since his own high school years. Mr. Blay was actually a former Stuyvesant High School student, graduating in 2009. While a student, he was a member of our sister team, FRC StuyPulse 694, and now he is a teacher at Stuyvesant (engineering design, precalculus, and technical drawing). His incredible dedication to the team is really an inspiration to us, reminding us, especially the seniors, the importance of coming back and continuing to influence and contribute to the team even after graduation. His presence is also what allows us to have our late night or weekend meetings that are crucial to ensuring that our robot is completed in a timely manner.

This year he has become more committed to helping our team get the furthest we have ever gotten. He has helped us come up with unique ideas for mechanisms, calculate torque and speed to make crucial choices, complete driver try-outs, etc. which will make this season our best yet.

##### Levi Olevsky
Mentor

Levi is a StuyPulse alum, who graduated just last year and now attends New York University. Since then he has come back and continued to work with 694 (our sister FRC team) as well as move more into FTC. He has helped us when weighing the pros and cons of many ideas as well as just being the rock of our team. Levi has become someone that many of us rely on for anything from a friend to a mentor.

##### Zhengqi Xi
Mentor

Zhengqi started as a mentor for us through a Bloomberg program and has been with us ever since. He is able to facilitate many of the conversations we have about design and engineering season because of his background in the fields of robotics and engineering.

##### Mel Hauptman
Mentor

Mel has helped us tremendously this year especially in our engineering process. Being a mechanical engineer, he has a very solid foundation and can predict all the faults of our designs. He has been useful when talking about all of our different hanging mechanisms and he has definitely helped us avoid some disastrous design issues. 

##### Rafael Colón
Former Coach

A noticeable gap in this lineup is our former head coach, Rafael Colón. While Mr. Colón has since retired, we are extremely grateful for all of the hard work, commitment and insights he has given us throughout the years. We are still following many of the precedents that he has set for us, including team-wide meetings at the start of each meeting where everyone, from president to newbie, is able to discuss exactly what we need to accomplish at this meeting.
