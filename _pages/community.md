#### Out of School Events

##### Book Drive
Our bi-annual book drive, which takes place on a busy Manhattan street corner through an entire Saturday, is one of our opportunities to demo our robots to the general public. Because Tribeca is both a professional and a residential neighborhood, we get the opportunity to talk about robotics and STEM with many businesspeople etc. who may not otherwise be interested in STEM as well as many children who are passing by with their parents. Since FTC robots are less dangerous, smaller and therefore easier to maneuver, we often allow children to try their hand at driving which is always a really exciting thing for them. We talk to many parents about what programs their kid may be able to get involved in including Jr. FLL or FLL. And since we are selling hundreds of used books, this is another way we fund our teams.

##### Barnes and Noble
Another way we are able to both spark interest in robotics among children while also fundraising is by partnering with the Barnes and Noble across the street from our school and doing a demonstration there. Then, by using a voucher, a portion of any purchase made would be donated to our team. So parents who enjoyed our demonstration were able to purchase cool books or toys in Barnes and Noble while helping our team fundraise.

##### Tutoring
Another way that we are able to help our local community is by tutoring. There are 3 elementary schools within a few blocks of us as well as a couple of middle schools. Last year we taught many different grades at once, which we will continue to do this year but this year we also had a specific SHSAT (the test required to get into one of the specialized high schools of which Stuyvesant High School has the highest cutoff) oriented tutoring program for 8th graders just a couple of months before they took the test for any last minute help or questions.

##### Mentoring
A large part of our team’s outreach is centered around mentoring FLL and other FTC teams. Between our members, we mentor a total of 6 FLL teams as well as 1 FTC team while starting 2 more which are still in their pre-rookie stages. Megan mentors a FLL team from RoboMindTech, Lili mentors a team from the Manhattan Montessori school named the Thunderbots, JT mentors two teams from Yung Wing Elementary School as well as two teams from I.S. 318. Our sister team, FRC StuyPulse 694 recently visited China as part of their outreach. While there they started FIRST Global which is meant to connect teams from all around the world. However, because of funding, the vast majority of these teams will end up being FTC teams rather than FRC teams. Our sister team was not interested in mentoring but we have been in communication with teams in Myanmar through a messaging platform called Discord. Two pre-rookie teams were also started by this team, one in a school for economically disadvantaged students who has a partnership with Grand Street Settlement for after school programs and another in Namibia!

We wanted to really boost the ability to help a team so far away so we are in the midst of starting our own YouTube channel. We are able to see now what rookie FTC teams really get stuck on and therefore will be better equipped to give information in these videos that will be relevant.

Mentoring FLL teams allows us to interact with the FIRST community in a way that is deeply impactful but also personally rewarding. Not only do we get to teach kids aspects of engineering and programming that will help them in competitions and experiences to come, but we also have a chance to get them interested in a field that does not always have a reputation for being silly, fun, or kid-friendly. It’s rewarding for us as mentors to watch kids having creating robots that, for example, say “ow!” when they bump into walls, or fall over giggling when the robot crashes and loses all of its wheels at once. They bring a silliness to robotics that is often hard to find in higher levels of competition. While we hope to inspire them to pursue their interest in STEAM, they remind us to approach challenges with creativity and whimsy.

#### In School Events

##### Bake Sales
Before many of the holidays, the Stuyvesant Robotics teams hosts a bake sale. Last year we held 4 but this year we hope to increase that number to 5 or 6. This is a great opportunity for us to connect with our school because with a school with over 3000 students, it is very easy for people to not know much about how the robotics team works or how we are doing. But this also helps with our funding. Every member of the team is required to bring in baked goods such as cookies, pies or cake which will then be sold to the school. Even selling at a dollar per plate we can make up to $1700! This year we have already had one bake sale for Halloween and will have another one right after our first qualifier on Monday, December 11th. Every member of our teams is required to volunteer their free periods/lunch periods to help sell these baked goods with the help with parents who stay around all day to help supervise and manage the money (a school rule is that students are not allowed to handle large amounts of money). Likewise, because we are not allowed to use phones in school, we also have no photos of these bake sales.

##### Food and Coat Drives
In conjunction with some of the big community service groups at Stuyvesant High School such as our school’s Red Cross club, we have hosted food drives every year in the recent past. We collect canned goods and other non perishable foods. Every member is required to bring in three items and Red Cross gives out hours for this as well to encourage their members to participate. This is the first year that we have done a coat drive which is still ongoing. It is very difficult to remain in good health without coats to keep warm during what can be really brutal New York winters. Thus far we have collected 137 coats and this coat drive is still ongoing.

##### Cyber Stuy and Open House
Partnering with the Computer Science department, Stuyvesant Robotics has hosted an interactive open house for NYC middle school students who may in the future attend Stuyvesant High School or go on to participate in STEM industries. We were able to discuss code, how CV helps us program our robots. We received many questions from interested students which we were very happy to see.

##### Stuy Splash
Based on the popular MIT Splash, Stuyvesant Robotics created an annual one day, robotics-centered event called Stuy Splash. Filled with presentations from industry leaders but also veteran members from our team, Stuy Splash is a fun experience for the range of teams that attend. In previous years, this was mostly for FRC teams, even though our school’s two FTC teams were involved. In fact, last year was the first time FTC teams gave presentations. A member of our team, Jonathan Lu, presented “Intro to Autodesk Fusion 360 for FTC” and Stuy Fusion 479, the other FTC team also presented. This year, while Stuy Fusion 479 is not presenting, two members of our team is. Jessica (JT) Tao, our president, is presenting “FTC: Design and Strategy” a presentation that will go over some of the most important parts of design choices FTC teams can make - the type of wheel for example or methods of lifting as well as talk about the importance of strategy and scouting in FTC competitions, something that is often neglected by rookie teams. Jonathan Lu will be speaking about 3D printing and giving a brief overview about how FTC teams can use this in their robot. Professor Hod Lipson, a robotics engineer from Columbia University, is our keynote speaker with a presentation titled “Endgame: The Six Waves of Robotics and AI”.

Stuy Splash has really grown in popularity in recent years. Last year about 80 people showed up but this year we have already gotten over 100 sign ups and there is still plenty of time to do so. We have made changes including a time for networking and we will be providing food this year to encourage more people to show up. We have had many more sign ups for speaking as well, in fact we now have enough to warrant holding 3 lectures at the same time. Our team is helping out at this event by contacting the NYC FTC teams through social media in hopes for this event to be more FTC oriented in the future as well.
