We are Stuy Fission 310, a FTC team from New York City. Our team is comprised of dedicated Stuyvesant High School students who not only wish to do well in competition but also to spread the values of FIRST. We all come from very diverse backgrounds; for some of us, this is our first time getting involved in STEM,  while others of us have been involved in FLL and other programs. Being part of the team not only allows us to be part of a family that shares the same interests, but it also allows us to learn from each other and grow.

Our team becomes a family not only because of our shared interests, but also because of the dedication each and every member shows. Members of our team juggle keeping their grades up in a competitive school as well as spending time together almost every day. In the final weeks of build season, the team stays after school until 9 pm, and then on Saturdays from 10 am to 5 pm. This is largely possible thanks to our hardworking mentors, whom we owe much of our success. On top of this, many of our members mentor FLL and other FTC teams.

Though these late meetings are often difficult to manage, they bring our team together. Late meetings include communal dinners, team bonding activities (snowball fights, stacking the cubes with our feet as well as actual bonding events like bowling etc.), and the sometimes hilarious situations that arise as we build (we really never fail to make each other laugh).

#### About Stuyvesant High School
Stuyvesant High School, a.k.a. “Stuy”, one of New York City’s specialized high schools for math and science, has demonstrated a tradition of excellence for over a century. Entrance is based on a rigorous and competitive test called the SHSAT; over 22,300 students take the exam every year and only about 900 are admitted to attend Stuy.

Totaling over 3200 students from all five city boroughs and diverse international backgrounds, Stuy is located in a modern, ten-story building in Lower Manhattan, having been relocated from the original building on East 15th Street in 1992.

#### What makes Stuy Fission unique?
One of the things we take pride in is our overwhelming diversity. Half of our team members were either born outside of the United States or are children of first generation immigrants.
Stuy Fission has also been a championship team over the last few years. Four years ago, we were the Alliance Captain at the New York City Regionals and advanced to Super Regionals. We were also on the Winning Alliance at the same regionals last year while winning the Dalton Qualifiers as the Alliance Captain, and this year, we have advanced to Regionals again, as the second pick on the Winning Alliance at John Dewey.
